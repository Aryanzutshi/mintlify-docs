description: Why AI accessibility remains limited and what needs to change

## The Problem

AI is advancing rapidly, but access to it remains uneven. Most AI-powered products assume users are comfortable with smartphones, apps, dashboards, or web interfaces. This creates a barrier for large segments of the global population who either lack reliable internet access, advanced devices, or the technical literacy required to engage with modern AI systems.

    As a result, AI adoption is disproportionately skewed toward digitally native users, leaving
    behind billions who still rely on simpler, more familiar communication channels.

## Why Existing Approaches Fall Short

Current solutions focus on improving interfaces rather than rethinking access. Even “simplified”
AI products often require app installs, logins, updates, or learning new interaction patterns.
This friction significantly limits everyday, habitual use, especially in emerging markets and
non-technical demographics.

  Accessibility is not just a UX problem — it is a distribution problem.

## The Core Gap

The missing layer is an AI interface that integrates seamlessly into tools people already trust
and use daily. Phone calls remain the most universal communication medium worldwide, cutting
across age, geography, income, and technical ability, yet they are largely ignored in modern AI
deployment.

<Warning>
  Until AI meets users where they already are, mass adoption will remain constrained.
