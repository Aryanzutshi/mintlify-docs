title: AI Agents
description: Autonomous, agentic AI systems that plan, reason, and act in complex environments
---

## Overview

In the context of generative artificial intelligence, **AI agents** (also known as *agentic AI* or *compound AI systems*) are autonomous software entities capable of reasoning, decision-making, and acting independently in complex environments.

Unlike traditional AI systems that respond only to explicit prompts, AI agents:
- Operate with minimal or no human supervision
- Maintain internal goals and state
- Use tools, memory, and planning systems
- Execute multi-step tasks end-to-end

Their control flow is typically driven by large language models (LLMs), augmented with memory, tools, and orchestration logic.

## Key Characteristics

AI agents commonly exhibit the following attributes:

- **Autonomy**: Ability to initiate and complete tasks independently  
- **Goal-oriented behavior**: Operate toward complex or evolving objectives  
- **Tool usage**: Invoke APIs, software tools, or other agents  
- **Memory**: Persist state across interactions  
- **Natural language interfaces**: Communicate and reason using human language  

There is no single, universally accepted definition of an AI agent, but most systems share these foundational traits.

---

## History

Research into AI agents dates back to the 1990s, though definitions were informal and fragmented. The term *agentic AI* gained mainstream attention in 2024–2025 as large language models demonstrated planning and tool-use capabilities at scale.

By late 2025, agentic systems began appearing in production environments across software development, research automation, and enterprise workflows.

---

## Training and Evaluation

AI agents are trained and tested using a variety of methods:

- **Reinforcement learning environments**
- **Simulated world models**
- **Game-based environments** (e.g. Minecraft-like worlds)
- **Web and software UI replicas**

These environments allow agents to learn planning, navigation, and tool use under realistic constraints.

---

## Autonomous Capabilities

Agent autonomy is often compared to self-driving vehicle classifications:

- **Level 1–2**: Assistive, prompt-driven agents  
- **Level 3**: Semi-autonomous task execution  
- **Level 4**: Fully autonomous in constrained domains  
- **Level 5**: Theoretical general autonomy  

Most real-world agents today operate between levels 2 and 3.

---

## Cognitive Architecture

Modern AI agents employ a combination of reasoning patterns and system components:

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- **ReAct (Reason + Act)** loops
- **Reflection and self-critique**
- **Tool and agent registries**
- **One-shot vs multi-step planning**

These components are orchestrated to enable perception, reasoning, action, and learning.

---

## Reference Architecture

A commonly cited AI agent reference architecture consists of seven layers:

1. **Foundation Models**  
2. **Data Operations** (vector databases, RAG pipelines)  
3. **Agent Frameworks**  
4. **Deployment & Infrastructure**  
5. **Evaluation & Observability**  
6. **Security & Compliance**  
7. **Agent Ecosystem & Interfaces**

Each layer builds on the previous to support scalable, safe, and observable agentic systems.

---

## Orchestration Patterns

Complex agents rely on orchestration workflows such as:

- **Prompt chaining**
- **Task routing**
- **Parallel execution**
- **Sequential pipelines**
- **Planner–critic loops**

These patterns enable decomposition and coordination across tasks and agents.

---

## Multimodal AI Agents

Beyond text-based LLMs, agents increasingly use multimodal models that process:

- Images
- Video
- UI interactions
- Sensor or robotic data

Multimodal agents enable software automation, robotics control, and visual reasoning.

---

## Applications

AI agents are currently used or piloted in:

- Software development
- Research automation
- Customer support
- Web browsing and task execution
- Analytics and reporting
- Cryptocurrency and financial tooling
- Video games and simulations

Adoption remains experimental, with ROI varying significantly by domain.

---

### Applications in Government

Governments have piloted AI agents for:
- Citizen support (e.g. 311 services)
- Tax and regulatory workflows
- Non-emergency call handling
- Internal research and document processing

These deployments raise both productivity opportunities and governance concerns.

---

### Operating Systems

AI agents are increasingly embedded into operating systems, enabling:
- Background task automation
- File and system interaction
- Cross-application workflows

Privacy and security concerns remain a major barrier to adoption.

---

### Web Browsing Agents

Agentic browsers can:
- Navigate websites
- Fill forms
- Perform repetitive actions
- Retrieve structured information

However, non-standard communication protocols and data exfiltration risks have drawn criticism.

---

## Proposed Benefits

Supporters argue AI agents can:

- Increase productivity
- Reduce cognitive load
- Automate repetitive work
- Enhance accessibility
- Assist in coordination and crisis response

Most experts agree agents are currently best suited for narrow, low-risk tasks.

## Concerns

### Agentic Misalignment

Key risks include:
- Goal misinterpretation
- Unintended actions
- Over-automation of sensitive workflows
- Hallucinated tool usage

---

## Security

Agent security remains an open challenge, requiring:
- Strong permission models
- Tool sandboxing
- Behavioral monitoring
- Auditability and logging

### Threat Modeling Frameworks

Emerging frameworks focus on:
- Agent capability containment
- Tool misuse prevention
- Data leakage mitigation
- Action verification
