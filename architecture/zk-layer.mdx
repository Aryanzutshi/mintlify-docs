## What is Zero-Knowledge?

A **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)** is a cryptographic protocol that allows one party (the *prover*) to convince another party (the *verifier*) that a statement is true **without revealing any information beyond the fact that the statement itself is true**.

In other words:
- The verifier gains *certainty*
- The prover retains *privacy*
- No secrets, metadata, or internal state are leaked

This makes zero-knowledge proofs fundamentally different from traditional verification systems, which often rely on disclosure of sensitive data.

## Core Properties

Every zero-knowledge proof satisfies three guarantees:

- **Completeness**  
  If the statement is true, an honest prover can always convince an honest verifier.

- **Soundness**  
  If the statement is false, a malicious prover cannot convince the verifier (except with negligible probability).

- **Zero-Knowledge**  
  The verifier learns *nothing* beyond the truth of the statement—no secrets, no intermediate data, no side information.

These properties make ZKPs ideal for trust-minimized systems.

## Interactive vs Non-Interactive ZK

Zero-knowledge proofs come in two primary forms:

- **Interactive ZK**  
  Multiple rounds of communication between prover and verifier.

- **Non-Interactive ZK (NIZK)**  
  A single proof generated by the prover and verified independently, often using techniques like the Fiat–Shamir heuristic.

Modern systems primarily use **non-interactive ZK proofs** for scalability and deployment simplicity.

## Why We Use Zero-Knowledge

In this system, **zero-knowledge is not used for privacy alone**.  
It is a **performance and security primitive**.

### 1. Increased Security

Zero-knowledge proofs allow us to verify:
- Authorization
- Session validity
- Correct usage
- Policy compliance  

**Without exposing**:
- User identity
- Credentials
- Call metadata
- Internal routing logic  

This dramatically reduces the attack surface by ensuring sensitive information is never transmitted or stored.

### 2. Increased Speed

Traditional security checks often require:
- Multiple round trips
- Database lookups
- Stateful validation
- Trust in centralized services  

With ZK proofs:
- Verification is **constant-time**
- Proofs are **self-contained**
- No additional secrets need to be fetched or validated  

This enables:
- Faster session setup
- Lower latency
- Reduced coordination between systems  

In short, **ZK replaces heavyweight verification with lightweight cryptographic certainty**.

## ZK in Our Architecture

Zero-knowledge proofs are used to generate a cryptographic proof that:

- A call is authorized  
- The session is valid  
- The requester satisfies access constraints  

This proof can be verified **instantly** by downstream systems without revealing:
- Who the user is
- What data they hold
- How the authorization was derived  

The result is a system that is:
- **Secure by design**
- **Fast by default**
- **Privacy-preserving at every layer**

## Practical Benefits

Using zero-knowledge proofs enables:

- Stateless verification  
- Reduced trust assumptions  
- Resistance to replay and impersonation attacks  
- Compliance-friendly validation (no data exposure)  
- Scalability without sacrificing security

## Summary

Zero-knowledge proofs allow us to **prove correctness, authorization, and validity without disclosure**.

By using ZK to generate verifiable proofs:
- **Security is strengthened** by eliminating data leakage
- **Speed is increased** by removing
