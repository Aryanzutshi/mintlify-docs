## What is Direct Inward Dialing (DID)?

**Direct Inward Dialing (DID)**—also known as **Direct Dial-In (DDI)** in Europe and Oceania—is a telecommunication service that allows external callers to directly reach internal extensions within an organization’s **Private Branch Exchange (PBX)** system without going through an operator or auto-attendant.

In simple terms:  
**one organization, many phone numbers, fewer physical lines.**

---

## How DID Works

With DID, a telephone service provider assigns a **range of phone numbers** to an organization and connects them to the organization’s PBX using a limited number of trunk lines.

When a caller dials a DID number:

1. The call is delivered to the PBX over a shared trunk.
2. The dialed number is passed to the PBX using **Dialed Number Identification Service (DNIS)**.
3. The PBX routes the call directly to the correct extension, queue, or service.

This eliminates the need for manual call routing and scales efficiently.

## DID vs Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS)

| Feature | POTS | DID |
|------|------|-----|
| One number per line | ✅ | ❌ |
| Operator required | Often | No |
| Scales efficiently | ❌ | ✅ |
| PBX integration | Limited | Native |

DID enables **many directory numbers** to be serviced using **far fewer physical circuits** than traditional analog phone setups.

## Trunking and Signaling

### Historical Implementation
- Originally delivered over **analog DID trunks**
- Signaling battery was supplied by **customer premises equipment**
- Reverse of standard POTS signaling logic

### Modern Implementation
- Predominantly delivered via:
  - **PRI (Primary Rate Interface)**
  - **SIP Trunking (VoIP)**

Modern SIP-based DID is far more flexible, scalable, and globally available.

---

## Inbound vs Outbound Calling

- **DID trunks** are traditionally **inbound-only**
- Often paired with **Direct Outward Dialing (DOD)**

With DOD:
- Internal extensions can place outbound calls directly
- Outbound Caller ID (CLI) can map to:
  - Individual DID numbers
  - A centralized organization number

---

## DID in VoIP and SIP Networks

DID is foundational in **VoIP** systems.

To allow PSTN users to call VoIP users:
- DID numbers are assigned to a **VoIP gateway**
- The gateway translates and routes calls between:
  - PSTN ↔ SIP / IP networks

This enables:
- Cloud PBX
- UCaaS platforms
- Contact center routing
- Global number portability

## DID for Fax Services

DID is widely used in **fax server architectures**:

- Multiple fax numbers
- Shared fax modems
- PBX or fax server routes by DID digits

### Why Centralized Fax Servers Still Matter

Even though standards like **T.38** exist:
- Upstream VoIP routing often breaks reliability
- Least-cost routing gateways may not support fax properly

Centralized fax servers connected directly to PSTN via **T/E-carrier PRI lines**:
- Ensure reliable fax delivery
- Convert faxes to **PDF/TIFF**
- Deliver via email or web portals

Fax traffic never touches unreliable VoIP paths.

---

## Vendors and Number Procurement

DID numbers can be sourced from:
- Competitive Local Exchange Carriers (**CLECs**)
- Interexchange carriers (for toll-free)
- SIP trunking providers
- International DID aggregators

### Pricing Model
- Monthly fee per number (often ~$1/month)
- Usage-based billing:
  - Per-minute
  - Per concurrent channel

Some regions (e.g., UK geographic numbers) may offer free DIDs when terminated over SIP.

---

## Global and International DID

- International DIDs can be purchased in bulk
- Numbers can appear local to the caller
- Calls terminate anywhere via SIP

This enables:
- Global presence
- Local customer experience
- Centralized infrastructure

---

## Direct Outward Dialing (DOD)

**Direct Outward Dialing (DOD)** is the outbound counterpart to DID.

Key features:
- Users place outbound calls without operator assistance
- Caller ID can reflect:
  - User’s DID
  - Central switchboard number

DOD + DID together form the backbone of modern enterprise telephony.

---

## Why DID Still Matters

Even in cloud-native architectures, DID remains critical for:

- PSTN interoperability  
- Scalable inbound routing  
- VoIP accessibility  
- Fax reliability  
- Global reach  

DID isn’t legacy—it’s infrastructure.

---

## Summary

Direct Inward Dialing enables enterprises to:
- Scale communication efficiently
- Eliminate manual call handling
- Integrate seamlessly with VoIP and cloud PBX systems
- Maintain reliable inbound voice and fax services

If your system touches the PSTN, **DID is unavoidable—and indispensable**.
