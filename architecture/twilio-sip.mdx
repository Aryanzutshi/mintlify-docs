title: Bring Your Own Carrier (BYOC) with SIP Trunking
description: Understand how BYOC works, why enterprises adopt it, and how SIP trunking unlocks flexibility, control, and global scale.
---

## Overview

As enterprises move from on-premise telephony to cloud-based communications, **SIP trunking** has become the backbone of modern voice infrastructure. While many UCaaS and CCaaS providers bundle PSTN connectivity by default, an increasing number of organizations are choosing **Bring Your Own Carrier (BYOC)** to regain control, reduce costs, and scale globally.

BYOC allows businesses to connect their cloud communication platforms directly to a preferred SIP trunking provider, decoupling application logic from telephony transport.

---

## What Is BYOC?

Bring Your Own Carrier (BYOC) is an **open SIP interface** offered by cloud communication platforms that enables enterprises to use a third-party PSTN provider instead of bundled calling.

With BYOC:
- The cloud platform handles **applications and features**
- The SIP provider handles **PSTN access and routing**
- SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) acts as the standard interface between them

Each concurrent call is routed over a SIP trunk, enabling flexible and programmable voice connectivity.

## Bundled PSTN vs BYOC

### Bundled PSTN Connectivity
- One vendor for application + telephony
- Simple setup and billing
- Limited control over routing
- Higher per-minute costs
- Restricted geographic coverage

### BYOC with SIP Trunking
- Separate best-in-class providers
- Independent number and routing control
- Global DID and toll-free availability
- Easier migration and provider switching
- Consistent call quality across regions

BYOC trades initial simplicity for long-term flexibility and operational control.

## Why Enterprises Choose BYOC

### Global Coverage
Specialist SIP providers typically offer phone numbers and PSTN access across **significantly more countries** than bundled UC platforms.

### Cost Efficiency
BYOC enables:
- Consolidated traffic pricing
- Negotiated enterprise rates
- Avoidance of bundled call markups

### Routing & Control
SIP trunking introduces an abstraction layer between PSTN and applications, allowing:
- Custom routing policies
- Failover and redundancy
- Dynamic reassignment of numbers
- Controlled migration between platforms

### Call Quality & Reliability
Dedicated SIP providers optimize routing across multiple carriers and geographies, often backed by SLAs and real-time traffic optimization.

## Architecture Overview

In a BYOC setup:

- Phone numbers are managed by the SIP provider
- Calls are routed over SIP trunks
- Cloud platforms map numbers to users, agents, or queues
- Optional enterprise SBCs enforce security and policy

This architecture separates **telephony transport** from **application intelligence**.

---

## When BYOC Makes Sense

BYOC is especially well-suited for:
- Multinational enterprises
- High-volume contact centers
- Hybrid cloud + on-prem deployments
- Organizations planning future vendor portability
- Teams requiring fine-grained call routing control

Smaller teams with limited geographic needs may prefer bundled PSTN for convenience.

---

## Tradeoffs to Consider

While powerful, BYOC introduces:
- An additional vendor relationship
- Potential SBC deployment and management
- Slightly higher initial setup complexity

For most large or growing organizations, these costs are offset by long-term savings and flexibility.

---

## Summary

BYOC transforms SIP trunking from a backend utility into a **strategic control layer**.

By separating PSTN connectivity from cloud communication platforms, enterprises gain:
- Lower costs
- Global reach
- Better call quality
- Architectural independence

In modern voice systems, **two providers are often better than one**.
